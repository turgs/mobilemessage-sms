  To receive inbound SMS messages and delivery receipts in real-time:
  
  1. Configure webhook URLs in your Mobile Message account settings:
     - Inbound URL: Receives SMS replies and unsubscribe requests
     - Status URL: Receives delivery status updates
  
  2. Set up webhook endpoints in your application:
     
     # Example Rails controller
     class WebhooksController < ApplicationController
       skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token
       
       def receive_sms
         webhook_data = client.parse_webhook(request.body.read)
         
         case webhook_data
         when MobileMessage::SMS::InboundMessage
           # Handle inbound SMS
           process_message(webhook_data)
         when MobileMessage::SMS::StatusUpdate
           # Handle delivery status
           update_status(webhook_data)
         end
         
         render plain: 'OK', status: :ok
       end
     end
  
  3. See webhook_handler.rb for a complete working example.
  
  Benefits of webhooks over polling:
  - Real-time notifications (instant delivery)
  - No API rate limits for receiving messages
  - More efficient (no repeated polling requests)
  - Lower latency
  - No missed messages
  - Scalable architecture
